# Introduction
This repo is used to store my coding challenges from https://codingchallenges.fyi. I want to improve my coding skills and this is just one of the ways I am doing so. 

# Challenges
1. Write Your Own wc Tool: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/
    - Written in Go.
2. Create your own web server: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-webserver/
    - Written in Go. 
    - Go already has concurrency built into their http api, so I didn't have to do anything special with that.
